    <h1><u>Mask Detection Dataset</u></h1>
    
    <p><img src="datasetimage.png" class="image" style="float: left; padding-right: 50px; height: 15vw;">Deep learning is a machine learning technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans.Deep Learning is called Deep because of the number of additional “Layers” we add to learn from the data.A dataset in machine learning is, quite simply, a collection of data pieces that can be treated by a computer as a single unit for analytic and prediction purposes.The more data you provide to the ML system, the faster that model can learn and improve.This external dataset has been downloaded of people’s images with and without masks from Kaggle.We can't find the kaggle link so we create a simple static website for linking our dataset's public shareabe gdrive link for everyone use this dataset for their own projects. The dataset consists of 1915 images of people wearing masks and 1918 images of people without wearing masks. In this dataset, 80% images are used as training data and 20% images are used as testing data.</p>
